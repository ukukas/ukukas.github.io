	<h1>The Life of Uku</h1>
	<h2>A Very Brief Summary</h2>
	<p>
		Uku was born on a beautiful spring day in 1995 in the humble city of
		Tallinn - the capital of Estonia. After a few years he finally got a
		playmate and his life became less lonely - his brother was born.
		Soon he went to kindergarten, but he did not like it there. He
		longed for a proper education - he wanted to go to school. Soon his
		wishes became true and 12 years of school passed surprisingly fast.
		Then Uku moved a little more south - to Tartu - the second largest
		city in Estonia. He enrolled in the local university and met some
		wonderful people. But something was not quite right - he felt that
		he had to leave the comfort of his homeland to explore and find
		himself. For the past two years Uku has lived in the United States.
		He likes it here. But the search still goes on.
